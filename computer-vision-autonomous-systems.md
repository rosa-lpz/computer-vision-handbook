# Computer Vision for Autonomous Systems

Computer Vision for Autonomous Systems is a core field that enables machines (like self-driving cars, drones, and robots) to perceive, understand, and act based on visual data from the world.

Computer vision allows an autonomous system to:

* See the environment (via cameras, LiDAR, radar)
* Understand what’s there (objects, people, roads, obstacles)

Decide what to do next (navigate, stop, avoid, interact)

In short:
Perception → Understanding → Action


Key Vision Tasks
Object Detection

Identifies and locates objects such as:

* Cars, pedestrians, cyclists
* Traffic signs and signals
* Obstacles and animals

Common models:

* YOLO
* Faster R-CNN
* SSD
